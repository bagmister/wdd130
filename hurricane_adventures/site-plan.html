      <p>
        Welcome to Hurricane Adventures! This site if for those that have a 2000 -2003 Thor\Fourwinds Hurricane motorhome. I have searched for information relating to the electrical and plumbing systems so I can maintain them myself but have not been able to find it. If you are a DIY'er and hae a Motorhome that is like this or similar to the one being described. This site is for you! I hope you find the information useful.

      <h3>Electricl</h3>
      <p>
        The Missing Breaker Panel - The electrical in a Motorhome is not the same standard and code that a residential home is. Some times there isn't a breaker panel with most of the motor homes. Some of the higher end ones do have them but most don't. Mine does not and so finding the main electrical is proved to be somewhat difficult. To start off let's think about what we have to work with. We essentially have 30 amps to work with total. A normal house has 100 or 200 or more for amps to work with as a comparison. Our electrical distribution box is in the Engine compartment in the upper driver side section. The picture to the right shows where in the engine bay we are talking about. It is not exactly easy to work on the electrical system for this motorhome.
        Diagram Of Electrical System - To the left is a diagram of the electrical circuits and how the system is built and designed. We will need this to isolate circuits. We will also need this to see the 12v circuit's and the 120v ac circuit's. With the 120v ac circuit's only running when shore power is connected or the generator is running to provide the power.
        Upgrades To Consider - Make sure your alternator is charging the house batteries and the chassis battery. If not replace the charger.

        Replace the inverter with a pure sinewave inverter.
        
        Replace all lights with LED lights to reduce wattage load requirement's.
        
        Add solar panel array to the top of the RV.
        
        Replace the batteries with Lithium batteries for the house batteries.

      <h3>Plumbing</h3>
      <p>
        The System - To Troubleshoot the plumbing system. We need to unddrstand how it works. When you look at the Driver's side of the RV in the back you will see two connectors. One for "City water" connection and one for a fresh water tank fill. With the Fresh water fill tank connection that will fill the fresh water tank on the RV. The City water connection by passes the fresh water tank and the water pump that is on board and just relies on the pressure coming into the RV and does NOT fill the fresh water tank.
        The system is a returnless system where it feeds water to sink in the bathroom and the kitchen sink and the water heater under the kitchen sink. All of pipeing used is a pex like material. The system is designed to not have more than 60 psi in the lines at any given point.
        used water is collected in the gray tank from the sinks and the black tank for waste. both drain from the same point on the RV. Underneath the RV on the drivers side by the frame next to the generator on the driver side.
        Most of the plumbing is not accesable in the RV. If tere is an issue with the water system in the RV. We will be looking at things from underneath the RV.
        We also need to go over how to winterize the RV if you are not going to use it during the winter in an noninsulated envirnment.
